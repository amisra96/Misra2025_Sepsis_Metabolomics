## 🧪 Study Overview

Metabolomics were performed on **liver tissues from mice** that either **survived or did not survive** sepsis. The goal was to identify **metabolic signatures associated with survival** and understand the biochemical pathways underlying **disease tolerance**.

---

## 🔬 Analysis

- **Machine learning approaches** were applied to the metabolomics dataset to:
  - Identify **differential metabolites** between survivors and non-survivors
  - Build predictive **classifiers** to distinguish the two groups
- Multiple ML techniques were used, including (but not limited to) **random forests, support vector machines, and logistic regression**.
- **Pathway analysis** was performed to highlight metabolic pathways that were **enriched or depleted** in survivors versus non-survivors.

## 📊 Visualizations

The repository also contains scripts and figures that provide:

- **Differential metabolite profiles**  
- **Classifier performance metrics**  
- **Pathway enrichment visualizations** for survival-associated metabolites
